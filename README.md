This application is a way to test out tools in a basic node application

### What is this repository for? ###

* Version 0.1
* Currently has one tool to recreate a new json object based on iterating through a geojson feature collection
* helpers/tools.js has a hard coded geojson feature at the moment
* this will later evolve to reading in a .geojson file and then specifying some of the parameters based on dynamically reading in properties and prompting for licence info etc.
